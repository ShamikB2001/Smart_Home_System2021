# Smart_Home_System2021
Smart home systems have become more prevalent in our life since they offer us a better quality of life and convenience. A smart home is a house that uses inter-connected devices to enable the remote monitoring and control of household appliances and systems. With the help of different sensors and devices, a person can access any service the smart home provides from a single location. We can access different devices like lights, fans, television sets, air conditioners, etc wirelessly by pressing a button on a smartphone. Our project presents the working of a smart home system using Bluetooth technology and its implementation. Bluetooth is a popular wireless standard that is used for many smart home devices like portable speakers, wireless earphones, smart locks, etc. The advantage of using Bluetooth is that it consumes very little power compared to wifi which gives Bluetooth-powered devices excellent battery life.
